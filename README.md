# Installation
Copy the .dll file in your plugins folder. A this moment stop and restart your server and it's done.

# Command
/gestionLoterie : Manage the lotery of your business

/mesTickets : the player can see the active ticket he have

/vendreTicket : Give a ticket to the player in front of you


# Uses cases
If a bar wants to conduct a lotery, it uses "/gestionLoterie". Once that's done and it decides to give away €10,000 with a ticket priced at €500, everything else is to be organized by the establishment. Apart from the plugin, it's up to them to ensure that the announced €10,000 is still available in the lotery. 

Information for other staff members of the bar can be viewed using "/gestionLoterie" if they are not aware. Everyone in the bar will be able to sell tickets to other citizens; the plugin doesn't handle the monetary transaction in case the lotery is free. By using the command "/vendreticket," they ask the player in front of them to choose a number. Once the bar has decided, they can draw a number and are responsible for checking with the citizens if their ticket is a winner. They can distribute the prize themselves because the plugin does not manage money transactions. 

Regarding people who have purchased a ticket, they can view all their tickets and display them by using "/mestickets".
